# Client-Server Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up the **Automated Patch Management System** with one machine as the **Server** and another as the **Client**.

## 1. Server Setup (This Machine)

You are currently on the **Server**.

1.  **Start the Server**:
    *   Double-click `start_system.bat` in the `d:\automated_patch_system` folder.
    *   This will start the web dashboard and the API server.
    *   Keep this window open.

2.  **Find Your Server IP**:
    *   Your Server IP address is: **172.22.205.250**
    *   (You can also find this by running `ipconfig` in a terminal and looking for "IPv4 Address").

## 2. Client Setup (The Other Machine)

*   **Network**: Both computers must be on the same network (e.g., connected to the same Wi-Fi or Router).
