## Why We Stopped
The user attempted to run `git_push.bat` but received the error `'git' is not recognized`. The user is restarting the computer to complete the Git installation.

## Next Steps (For User)
1.  Ensure you have installed Git (from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win)).
2.  Open this folder: `d:\automated_patch_system`.
3.  Double-click **`git_push.bat`**.
4.  Enter your GitHub Repository URL when prompted.

## Instructions for AI Assistant
If you are an AI assistant helping the user after they restart:
1.  **Read this file** to understand the context.
2.  Ask the user if they successfully ran `git_push.bat`.
3.  If yes, the project is complete.
4.  If no, help them troubleshoot the Git installation or the push process.
5.  **Do not** re-initialize the repo; it is already done.
